# Snake

## What's this?

This is a simple sdl port of snake. I will (probably) not be maintaining it, just because this was a one-off project that doesn't really need any additions.

## How to play?

Use the arrow keys or vim keys to move and don't hit yourself while eating apples (red squares) to grow.
