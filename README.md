# Snake

## What's this?

This is a simple ncurses/sdl port of snake. I will (probably) not be maintaining it, just because this was a one-off project that doesn't really need any additions.

The `master` branch contains the ncurses version, whereas the `sdl` branch contains the SDL2 version.

## How to play?

Use the arrow keys or vim keys to move, don't hit the walls, and don't hit yourself while eating apples (\*) to grow.
